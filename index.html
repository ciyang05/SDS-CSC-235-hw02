            <p id="synopsis">The raw data used in this analysis derives from a Stack Overflow Developer survey completed<br>
            in 2025. It measures multiple variables of over 49,000 developers such as converted salary, age group,<br>
            highest education level and more. The raw data can be found <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/">here.</a><br>
            The data captures an overview of the experiences of developers in 2025 across many circumstances.<br>
            Some of the biases present in the data are inaccurate/incomplete values entered and participant bias. Elaborating on<br>
            these biases, for some entries in the raw data, inaccurate values were entered such as when it came to asking how many<br>
            years the individual had been coding for, some participants responded with "100." As for participant bias, some<br>
            individuals who took the survey may have responded in a way that fits the expectations of the surveyor.
